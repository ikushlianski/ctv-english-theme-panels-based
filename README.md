DRUPAL THEME BASED ON ZEN STARTER KIT. BUILT WITH DRUPAL PANELS MODULE
----------------------
<b>CUSTOMER</b>: CTV Channel, Belarus, Minsk.

Our TV company's English website http://en.ctv.by needed a new theme and I made one for them using traditional regions and blocks provided by Drupal's core.

However, the technical supervisor of the website asked me to rebuild the theme using Panels module, since other parts of the site (in particular the Russian version) were also made on Panels. This was required for consistency.

It took me about 2.5 weeks to learn Panels and rebuild the site using them. Panels are a bit inconvenient for me to work with (since I cannot fully control markup), but they are faster if one uses their wonderful caching abilities.

<b>UPD</b>: New leadership decided to close CTV Channel's English version from April 1, 2018.
New website will no longer be available live. Please see the design and the project at <a href="http://ilya.online/en/works/english-version-of-ctv-by-website">ilya.online</a>.
